Gradient Checker for Neural Networks

This module provides functionality to check and analyze gradients in neural networks
during training. It helps identify issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients,
which can significantly impact model performance and training stability.

Key Features:
- Register hooks to capture gradients during backpropagation
- Compute and store gradient statistics for each layer
- Visualize gradient distributions using histograms
- Detect potential gradient issues and provide warnings

Usage:
1. Initialize the GradientChecker with your model
2. Perform a training step
3. Call the analyze_gradients method to get insights

Example:
    checker = GradientChecker(model)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss = criterion(model(inputs), targets)
    loss.backward()
    checker.analyze_gradients()

Functions:
- register_hooks(model): Attach gradient hooks to all parameters of the model
- compute_grad_stats(grad): Calculate statistics for a given gradient tensor
- analyze_gradients(): Perform analysis on collected gradients and print results
- plot_grad_flow(named_parameters): Visualize gradient flow across layers

Classes:
- GradientChecker: Main class for setting up and performing gradient analysis

Note:
This module is designed for use during the development and debugging phase of
neural network training. It may introduce some computational overhead and
should be used judiciously in production environments.

Dependencies:
- torch
- numpy
- matplotlib
